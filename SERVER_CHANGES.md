# Server Changes - Simplified Architecture

## What Changed

The server has been completely simplified to remove all restaurant scraping functionality. The system now relies entirely on Firebase database for menu data.

## Removed Features

- ❌ Puppeteer browser automation
- ❌ Screenshot-based menu analysis  
- ❌ Gemini API integration for scraping
- ❌ Complex website exploration logic
- ❌ Menu scraping endpoints
- ❌ Screenshot storage and management
- ❌ All scraping-related dependencies

## Current Server Structure

The server is now a simple Express.js application with:

### Dependencies (Simplified)
- `express` - Web framework
- `cors` - Cross-origin resource sharing
- `nodemon` - Development server (dev dependency only)

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /api/info` - Server information

### Key Features
- ✅ Lightweight and fast
- ✅ No external scraping dependencies
- ✅ Ready for Firebase integration
- ✅ Simple deployment

## How It Works Now

1. **Menu Data Source**: All restaurant menu data comes from Firebase database
2. **Frontend Integration**: The frontend will read menu data directly from Firebase
3. **Server Role**: The server provides basic health checks and can be extended for other API needs
4. **No Scraping**: Restaurant websites are no longer scraped automatically

## Next Steps

1. **Add Menu Data to Firebase**: Manually add restaurant menus to your Firebase database
2. **Frontend Updates**: Ensure your frontend reads menu data from Firebase
3. **Optional Extensions**: Add any additional API endpoints you need for your app

## Running the Server

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The server will run on port 3001 by default and serve basic health check endpoints.
